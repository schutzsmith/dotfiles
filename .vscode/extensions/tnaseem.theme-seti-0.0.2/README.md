# Seti theme for Visual Studio Code
Port of Seti theme with some modifications to work better with C#. I mainly created this to try and match the Seti theme in Sublime Text 3.

So, if you're using vscode with Unity, this is the theme for you :)

## Install
In VSCode press F1, search "ext install" followed by extension name, in this case: "ext install Seti Modified" without the ">". Alternatively, if you prefer: ">ext install", hit enter, search "Seti Modified".

## Contributions
Feel free to modify, distribute and do whatever with it, without any restrictions. Probably needs some work for other languages (PHP, HTML), so go ahead and modify.

## Release Notes
**Version 0.0.2**
* Updated the text foreground colour to get rid of the slight blue tinge.
* Updated screenshots to reflect the change. The PHP screenshot was from Sublime Text (oops!), so removed.


**Version 0.0.1**
* Initial release
